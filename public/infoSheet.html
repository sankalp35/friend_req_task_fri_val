   <p style="text-align:left;"><strong>1. Background and aims of the study</strong><br>

       The primary aim of this study is to find out more about how people learn from feedback and how this relates to
       people’s personality traits and mood. We hope that a better understanding of these processes will, in the
       future, contribute to the development of new approaches to improve mental wellbeing.<br><br>

       This study is funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.<br><br>

       <strong>2. Why have I been invited to take part? </strong><br>

       You have been invited because you have responded to an advert for this study. To take part in this
       study, you need to be between 18 and 40 years old. You also need to have normal or corrected to
       normal vision and hearing.<br><br>

       <strong>3. Do I have to take part? </strong><br>

       No.  You can ask questions about the study before deciding whether or not to participate by emailing
       the principal researcher (address details below). If you do agree to participate, you may withdraw yourself
       from the study at any time, without giving a reason and without penalty. <br><br>

       <strong>4. What will happen in the study? </strong><br>

       If you are happy to take part in the study, you will be asked to perform a simple computer task which will involve making choices to gain points.
      Choices are presented to you in the form of a game in which you decide between alternative courses of actions which will result in more or less points.
      The game was designed to be fun to play. You will also be asked to complete questionnaires that will measure psychological traits and mental well-being.
      For example, it will ask you questions about whether or not you experience low mood or anxiety, and there will also be questions about your sleep quality and the things you enjoy doing.<br><br>

       This should take approximately 1 hour.<br>
       The study will take place online. <br>
       There will not be any follow-up sessions.<br><br>

       <strong>5. Are there any potential risks in taking part? </strong><br>

       Psychological and/or psychiatric questionnaires may be perceived as distressing or intrusive. If you
       experience significant distress as a result of the questionnaires, you can immediately stop the study. In this case you
       will still be reimbursed for your time in the study so far. We will also provide you with links to sources of advice and support when you exit the study. <br><br>

       <strong>6. Are there any benefits in taking part? </strong><br>

       There will be no direct benefit to you from taking part in this research. You will not receive results or
       psychiatric/psychological assessments from the questionnaires. <br><br>

       <strong>7. Expenses and payments </strong><br>

       You will be reimbursed for your time in the study via the third party website administering the study.
       You will receive £5 per hour and a flexible bonus depending on the choices you make in the online task
       (up to £7 per hour overall payment).<br><br>
